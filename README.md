# sn-portfolio
WordPress Plugin for displaying portfolio pieces with a customizable archive/index page.

### Details

SN Portfolio is a Custom Post Type with a customizable `/portfolio/` index page. "Featured" portfolio pieces will appear on the index page, in the order you specify.

Index page titles and descriptions are customizable for each portfolio piece, and an external source optionally provided. The index page is mobile responsive, and will automatically adjust layout to suit the number of pieces you have displaying.

Featured pieces also show up in the "other pieces" sidebar, visible while viewing an individual portfolio piece. Other pieces of the same media type (a custom taxonomy for portfolio pieces) will show up higher in the "other pieces" sidebar.
